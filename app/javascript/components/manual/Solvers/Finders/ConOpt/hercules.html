<h1 align=center>Solver HERCULES</H1>

<P>HERCULES is a special constrained optimization solver for linear, 
integer, and mixed-integer problems. Unlike the general solvers it 
can only be applied to models, which contain linear relationships.</P>

<P>The restrictions upon HERCULES can best be described by contrasting 
it with the typical general solver, such as THOR or JOVE.  The key 
differences are:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>The function to be optimized must be a linear function 
of the independent variables. Thus, if x is a vector of independent  variables, 
then the objective function must take the following form:<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>	f = c<SUB>0</SUB> + c<SUB>1</SUB> + c<SUB>2</SUB>x<SUB>2</SUB> 
+ ... + c<SUB>n</SUB>x<SUB>n</SUB></i><BR>

where <i>c<SUB>0</SUB></i> and <i>c<SUB>1</SUB></i> are constants, 
not all of which are zero.<BR></li>

<li>There must be at least one constraint and all constraints 
must be linear functions of the independent variables.  In vector  notation, 
the constraints must take the form:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> <B>a x</B></i> &ge; <B><i>b</i></B><BR>
where some or all may be equalities or inequalities.</li>

<li>The independent variables must be non-negative and, in fact, no lower clause 
is permitted in the FIND statement. Thus, the additional limits may be expressed as:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<i> &le; <B>x</i></B>  &le; <B>u</B><BR>
where the constants <MIO>u<D> are optional upper limits on the independents.</li>
</ol>

<P> Special capabilities of HERCULES include:</P>

<UL>

<LI><i>Integer and Mixed Integer Programming</i> - any or all 
of the  independent variables may be restricted to integer values, 
and in fact, even to a limited subset of the integers.</LI>

<LI><i>Discrete Objectives</i> - The objective function may 
be limited to  integral values.</LI>

<LI><i>Zero-one Programming</i> - The special case of integer 
programming  in which all variables take on only the values zero and 
one can  be handled.  The classical assignment problem is a case in  point.</LI>

<LI><i>Restart Feature</i> - A checkpoint may be requested on 
any  premature termination.  The problem may then be completed from  this 
point without repeating previous calculations.</LI>

<LI><i>Problem Size Control</i> - Several techniques are used 
to permit  very large problems to be solved.  There is no predefined 
limit  on the number of variables or equations.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The general FIND statement for HERCULES is:</P>
<blockquote>
<B>FIND</B> <i>unknowns</i><B> IN</B> <i>model</i><B>  BY 
HERCULES</B>{<B>(</b><i>controller</i><B>)</B>}<B></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{<B>HOLDING</b><i> inequalities</i><B></B>}
  {<B>MATCHING</B> <i>equalities</i><B></B>}<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{{<B>WITH</B>} <B>UPPERS</B> <i>ceiling</i>} {{<B>WITH</B>|<B>AND</B>} 
<B>DISCRETES</b> <i>steps</i><B></B>} <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{{<B>WITH</B>|<B>AND</B>} <B>FLAG</B>  <i>signal</i><B></B>}<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>TO MINIMIZE</B>|<B>MAXIMIZE</B>  <i>objective</i><BR>
</blockquote>

<P>The meaning and usage of all elements of this statement are identical 
to those described for JOVE in section 7.1, with the exception of 
the new DISCRETES clause.</P>

<P>The DISCRETES clause identifies unknowns which are to be restricted 
to integral values and further specifies their step sizes.  If this 
clause is present, the list <i>steps</i> must contain an entry for 
every element of the<i> unknown</i>s.  Any entry with a value of zero 
is ignored and the corresponding unknown is free to take on any feasible 
continuous value.  A discrete variable with step size <i>n</i> can 
only take values which are integral multiples of <i>n</i> and HERCULES 
will restrict its search accordingly.  Thus, if there are 3 independent 
variables and the steps are specified by a vector called STP, then 
the following initialization will have the given consequences :<BR>

<ol type="a">

<li>DATA STP /0,0,1/<BR>
only X(3) will be discrete and its step size will be 1;</li>

<li>DATA  STP/10,10,10/<BR>
all unknowns are discrete and all have step sizes of 10.</li>

</ol>

<P>Obviously, it is not essential to limit a discrete variable to non-unit 
steps, but it is highly desired to do so if possible.  For one thing, 
scaling problems in defining the constraints will be reduced, thereby 
eliminating a potential for numerical difficulty.</P>

<P>The flag variable <i>signal</i>, if present, will be used to signal 
whether the solution was successful or not.  It will be zero unless 
the solution process terminated prematurely because an iteration, 
recheck, or storage limit was exceeded.</P>

<P>The way in which the model is used in the solution process differs 
from the other optimization solvers. Even though HERCULES employs 
an iterative solution technique, it does not call the model at all 
during optimization.  Instead, it calls it only during initialization 
and after the solution is achieved.  The preliminary calls are used 
solely to extract information which defines the problem, i.e. the 
various linear coefficients of the constraints and the objective function.  During 
these calls, gradients may be computed on some or all of the unknowns.  The 
number of calls depends upon the available data storage space.  For 
small problems, this number will be in the range 2-10, for very large 
problems and medium-sized memory allocations, the number may go as 
high as 100. The number of calls may be minimized by providing a sufficiently 
large memory allocation for execution.  As guided by experience, the 
terminating call is used simply to recalculate the constraints using 
the converged values of the unknowns.</P>

<P>HERCULES cannot be employed while partial derivative evaluation is 
in progress and thus cannot be nested within another calculus process.</P>

<P><i>Zero-One Programming</i> - The standard zero-one integer programming 
problem is specified  by setting both DISCRETE and ONEZERO to one 
and omitting both  UPPERS and DISCRETES clauses from the FIND statement.  Be  careful 
to give meaningful combinations of these controls and  clauses.</P>

<P><i>Solution Report</i> -  The solution report generated by HERCULES 
essentially summarizes  the initial conditions and controls and shows 
the final values of the objective, unknowns, and constraints.  HERCULES  automatically 
scales the constraints for the purpose of  minimizing computational 
error and those displayed incorporate  the scale factors.  Values 
of the program variables may be  printed separately to obtain the 
true constraint values.  The  report also shows the actual number 
of iterations and accuracy  rechecks required as well as the maximum 
problem size (see  below).  These are guides for subsequent settings 
of the control variables REMAX, RECHECK, and SIZE.</P>

<P><i>Problem size</i> - The maximum problem size is given by  SIZE = 
min(<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>)  where<i> m</i> = total number of equality 
and inequality constraints and <i>n</i> = number of unknowns.  Most 
problems will not require the maximum size, although only  experience 
can show what is needed.  This value is used to dimension some internal 
arrays used by HERCULES and an unnecessarily large value will require 
more memory allocation than will be used, and perhaps even more than 
is available for very large problems. The solution report shows the 
actual size employed, and this may be used as a guide in later runs 
of the same  or similar problems.  A reasonable estimate for medium 
sized  problems is about 75 percent of the maximum value.</P>

<P><i>Tolerance Controls</i> - Settings of the tolerance controls require 
some judgment and expertise.  However, experience has shown the default 
values to be acceptable for a wide range of problems.  If any of the 
related variables have  conspicuously large or small values (say outside 
of the rough range 10<SUP>-3</SUP> to 10<SUP>+3</SUP>), the defaults may not 
be valid.  It is desirable, if not to inconvenient, to scale the model 
variables to about order unity.  The number of accuracy rechecks in 
the solution report is an  indicator of the validity of the chosen 
tolerance controls.  If  this number is more than 2 or 3, some tolerances 
are probably too tight.</P>

<P><i>Checkpointing a Problem Run</i> - If SAVE is nonzero, a solution 
checkpoint is written to this file number in any circumstance in which 
a converged solution is not achieved.  This can be due to reaching 
an iteration or recheck limit or alternatively to an apparently infeasible 
or unbounded problem.  The latter cases usually arise from improperly 
set tolerance  controls.  A final case can arise from exceeding the 
specified problem size.  To use this facility, the SAVE file must 
be opened and subsequently saved.</P>

<P><i>Restarting a Checkpointed  Run</i>  - To restart from a saved checkpoint, 
a special statement is used as follows:</P>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RESUME(</B><i>file</i><B>)</B> <i> unknowns</i> <B> BY HERCULES</B>{<B>(</B><i>controller</i><B>)</B>}<B></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{<B>WITH </B>}<B> FLAG</B> <i>signal</i><B> </B>}<B> TO OPTIMIZE </B><i>objective</i><BR>

<P>where <i>file</i> is the logical unit number of the file containing 
the checkpoint,<i> unknowns </i>is an array dimensioned at least as 
large as the originally defined independent variables of  the checkpointed 
problem, <i>controller</i> is a new controller procedure, <i>signal</i> 
and <i>objective</i> are output variables corresponding to the flag 
and objective variables of the checkpoint.</P>   

<P>This statement resumes the checkpointed FIND statement and does not 
require respecification of the model.  The output <i>unknowns</i>, 
<i>signal</i>, and <i>objective </i>may be used in subsequent computation 
or output statements as desired.</P>

<P>New control values may be specified in the controller procedure, including 
all but DISCRETE, INTEGER,  and ONEZERO.  These three cannot be changed 
without redefining the problem being solved.  <i>If any controls 
are not set in this manner, they take their default values, not the 
values in effect when the  checkpoint was taken.</i>   It is also  valid 
to create another checkpoint by setting an appropriate file number 
to SAVE.  If this number is the same as the original checkpoint, the 
original one will be overwritten.</P>

<H4>Examples</H4>

<P><i>Continuous Linear Programming</i> - The first example is a feed-blending 
optimization.  It is desired to blend ingredients in the least expensive 
way such than the stated restrictions are satisfied:</P>

<LI>Total weight of blend = 2000 lb.</LI>
<LI>Total protein &ge; 200 lb.</LI>
<LI>Total fat &ge 54 lb.</LI>
<LI>Total fiber &le; 90 lb.</LI>
<LI>Amount of corn between 400 and 1000 lb.</LI>
<LI>Weight of salt used = 5 lb.</LI>
</OL>

The program is as follows:<BR>

<PRE>
      GLOBAL ALL
      PROGLEM BLEND
        SALT=5 : BARLEY=500 : CORN= 900 : SCREENS=595
        FIND BARLEY,CORN,SCREENS IN MIX BY HERCULES
     ~     HOLDING PROTEIN, FAT, FIBER, CORNLOW, CORNHIGH
     ~      AND MATCHING WEIGHT TO MINIMIZE COST
      END

      MODEL MIX
        WEIGHT=BARLEY+CORN+SCREENS+SALT-2000
        PROTEIN=0.115*BARLEY+0.086*CORN+0.13*SCREENS-200
        FAT=0.02*BARLEY+0.038*CORN+0.03*SCREENS-54

        COST=0.025*BARLEY+0.028*CORN+0.022*SCREENS+0.011*SALT
      END
</PRE> 

The solution is:<BR>

 
<PRE>
      COST      $51.34
      BARLEY    465.00 LB
      CORN      1000.00 LB	
      SCREENS   530.00 LB
      SALT      5.00 LB
</PRE> 

<P><i>Mixed Integer Programming</i> - A slight variation fo the preceding 
example shows the consequence of imposing the reasonable restriction 
that the barley and corn ingredients can only be purchased in 50 lb. 
lots.  The problem then becomes a mixed integer problem as follows:</P>

<PRE>
      GLOBAL ALL
      PROBLEM BLEND2

     ~     HOLDING PROTEIN,FAT,FIBER,CORNLOW,CORNHIGH
     ~     TO MINIMIZE COST
      END
</PRE>
 

The Solution is now:<BR>

</PRE> 

<P><i>Integer Programming</i> - A third example is a classical transportation 
problem, in which it is desired to minimize the delivery cost in stocking 
three warehouses from seven distributed manufacturing plants.  The 
deliveries to the warehouses must be 700, 900, and 400  items per 
month respectively, while the plants have production capacities of 
100, 300, 400, 200,300, 300, and 400 items per month respectively.  This 
information is conveniently shown in a transportion cost matrix in

<P><i>Zero-One Programming</i> - The last example is a classical assignment 
problem, i.e. a zero-one integer programming problem.  The Lehigh 
Co. is assigning 5 production orders to its 5 departments so as to 
minimize the cost of production.  Each department must get exactly 
one job and all production orders must be filled.  The cost of production 
per department for each type of job is as follows:</P>
