<h1 align=center>Solver ZEUS</h1> 

<P>ZEUS applies the same general approach as JOVE for the solution of 
constrained optimization problems. However, its method for performing 
the unconstrained suboptimizations is a variation of the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell 
(DFP) technique. This is a first-order technique, employing only 
gradients, in contrast with the second-order technique of JOVE. By 
way of comparison, ZEUS will often prove more reliable for problems 
in which the Hessian matrix of the augmented objective is ill-conditioned. </P>

<P>The general form of the FIND statement for ZEUS is:
<blockquote>
<B>FIND</B> <i>unknowns</i><B> IN</B> <i>model</i><B> BY 
ZEUS </B>{<B>(</B> <i>controller</i><B>)</B>}<B></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{<B>WITH</B>|<B>AND</B>} <B>LOWER</B> <i>floor</i><B></B>}
   {<B>WITH</B>|<B>AND</B>} <B>UPPER</B> <i>ceiling</i><B></B>}<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{<B>REPORTING</B> <i>auxiliaries</i><B></B>}
   {<B>WITH  FLAG</B> <i>signal</i><B></B>}<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{<B>HOLDING</B> <i>inequalities</i><B></B>}
   {<B>MATCHING</B> <i>equalities</i><B></B>}<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>TO MINIMIZE</B>|<B>MAXIMIZE</B> <i>objective</i><BR><BR>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for the BY solver clause, which invokes ZEUS, the form, meaning, 
and usage of this statement is identical to that described for JOVE.</P>

<P>When ZEUS is invoked by execution of the FIND statement, it activates 
derivative evaluation to compute gradients with respect to the unknowns.</P>

<P><i>The Solution Process</i> -  As noted above, the 
solution process is identical to that of JOVE, except that a Davidon-Fletcher-Powell 
(DFP) technique is used to select a direction for performing each 
of the sequence of unconstrained suboptimization. The ZEUS controls 
are also the same as those for JOVE, except that the SEARCH switch 
has no significance.</P>
