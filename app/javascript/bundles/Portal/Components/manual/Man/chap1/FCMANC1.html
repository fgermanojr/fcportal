<h1>1. The Calculus Environment</h1>

The FC Environment is a special software design for calculus processing, 
consisting of:
<ul>
<LI>A set of environment programs</LI>

<LI>A special memory organization</LI>

<LI>A special set of data structures</LI>
</ul>
It involves the dynamic recasting of real variables into linked data 
structures, and the overloading of real variable arithmetic operations 
to facilitate differential arithmetic.  Thus real variables can exist 
in two modes:<ul><LI>Ordinary mode - Real*8 variables containing normalized floating 
point numbers, and</LI>

<LI>Calculus mode - Real*8 variables containing pointers to 
calculus operand structures, including partial derivative arrays.</LI>

</ul>The contexts where real variables are in calculus mode are separate 
mathematical domains, i.e. coordinate systems.  These contexts are 
separate (lower) levels in program hierarchies, created by the action 
of the calculus macro statements, i.e., they are below the macro statements 
in the hierarchy.  In these calculus contexts, ordinary processing 
of real variables is outlawed.  All real arithmetic and assignment 
operations are overloaded.  Consequently all calls to lower level 
procedures are limited. They must be:<p>(a) Calls to MODELS or FMODELS<br>(b) Performed via INCALL or OUTCALL macro statements, 
or<br>(c) Not involve real variables.</p>

<H2>   Environment Programs</H2>

The environment programs are a large set of library subroutines that 
make up the  bulk of calculus programs (often more than 90 %).  These 
programs are organized into a central subsystem called the FC Virtual 
Machine (FCVM) and a set of <MI>solver<D> subsystems.

The FCVM contains the differential arithmetic primitives, the array 
operation subroutines, the common solver interface subroutines, all 
data and environment management subroutines, and common utilities 
used by more than one solver.

The solver subsystems are individual algorithms and polyalgorithms 
designed to solve generic mathematical problems.  They are the solution 
elements of calculus processes described in the next chapter.  Solvers 
are invoked and controlled by the macro statements FIND, INITIATE, 
and INTEGRATE, and they operate on MODEL and FMODEL procedures.     
<div>
<H2>  Memory Organization&nbsp; [REPLACE w simple abstraction]</H2>

The environment memory is divided into two primary storage regions:
<ul>
<LI>The "Bucket":  a large common block (FC3000) which acts 
as a bulk data memory to the FC virtual machine.  All of its internal 
structures are dynamically managed by the FCVM;</LI>

<LI>The Variables Dynamic Table (VDT): a computing buffer employed 
for temporary storage of calculus mode variable values and for the 
computation of calculus expressions.</LI> </ul>


The sizing of these two storage regions is defined by the first two 
parameters on the PROBLEM statement.

<B><i>Bucket Structure </i></b>- The bucket is divided into three dynamic 
regions as shown in Fig. 1-1.  The upper region is used for temporary 
storage of partial derivative values.  The middle region is used for 
temporary storage of arbitrary blocks of values such as arrays, and 
the bottom region is a pair of stacks used for expression processing 
and process management by the FCVM.     Each cell in the bucket is 
a 64-bit double word used to store either real*8 values, a pair of 
32-bit integer pointers or an 8-character name.
<br>

<B><I>Variable s Dynamic Table (VDT)</i></B>  -  The VDT is a smaller common 
block (FC3007) having the structure shown in Fig 1-2.

The upper region of the VDT is allocated to calculus-mode variables 
in the order that they are stored in a calculus process.  The lower 
region is temporarily used as an execution stack during processing 
of an expression, thus it is abandoned when the value of the expression 
is stored.

A variable cell in the VDT is two 64-bit cells, the upper containing 
a real*8 value, and the lower containing up to two integer pointers.

<B><I>Calculus-Mode Linkage</i></b>  -  When a real variable is converted 
from ordinary mode to calculus mode, its value is moved from its original 
address (variable-cell) to a new address in the VDT; and a cross-linkage 
is established between the variable cell and the VDT entry.  This 
mode conversion occurs whenever an assigned expression is differentiated 
and assigned to a variable, or when a constant is assigned to a variable 
that was previously differentiated.  These two cases are illustrated 
in Figure 1-3 and Figure 1-4 respectively.

In the first case, the partial derivatives resulting from differentiating 
the expression are stored in the upper region of the bucket and a 
pointer to this "partials node" is stored in the first integer cell 
of the VDT entry.  Also a pointer to the original variable cell is 
stored in the partials node.

In the second case, where a constant is assigned to a variable that 
previously had partials, the partials node is destroyed (returned 
to free storage) and a pointer to the original variable cell is stored 
in the second integer cell of the VDT entry.

<H2>1.3 Macro Statements</H2>

The FC macro statements are the extensions to FORTRAN 77 syntax that 
are translated by the FC translator into FORTRAN 77 statements.  The 
following is the identifying prefix of each macro statement and a

@PAGE BREAK = 

<H3>  Context Declaration Syntax</H3>

The following describes the syntax of the macro statements which initiate 
and qualify procedure contexts.  Further descriptions of these statements 
are given elsewhere as noted in each case

@ITEM HEAD =    PROBLEM Declaration

@MINOR HEADING =  Syntax:

@STATFORMAT =  <B>PROBLEM<D> <BI> <MI>name<D> {<B>(<MI>bucketsize<D> 
{<B>,<MI>vdtsize<D>{<B>,<MI>stacksize<D>}}<B> )<D> }

@MINOR HEADING =  Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>name<D>		:	identifying name (1-8 characters) 

@NOBULTAB = <MI>bucketsize<D>		: integer literal				 =  size of bucket 
storage (default =5000) 

@NOBULTAB = <MI>vdtsize<D>			: integer literal   = size of VDT  (default 
= 1000) 

@NOBULTAB = <MI>stacksize<D>		: integer literal   = size of stack 
region of bucket (default = 1000)

This declaration generates a main program (FC000000) containing sized 
common blocks for the bucket and VDT storage, and initialization data 
statements.  The program unit identified by name becomes a subroutine 
which is called by the main program.

@ITEM HEAD =    CONTROLLER Declaration

@MINOR HEADING =  Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>name<D>			: identifying name (1-8 characters) 

@NOBULTAB = <MI>solver			<D>: solver name

This declaration generates a subroutine heading and a common block 
declaration for the common block /C<MI>solver<D>/ used to communicate 
control parameters to the solver.

@ITEM HEAD =    MODEL Declaration

@MINOR HEADING =  Syntax:

@STATFORMAT =  <B>MODEL<D>  <MI>name <D>{<B>(<MI>parameters<B>) <D>}

@MINOR HEADING =  Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>name		<D>	: identifying name (1-8 characters)  

@NOBULTAB = <MI>parameters<D>	: list of dummy parameters

This declaration generates a subroutine heading and initiates translation 
of the real variable assignment statements into overloaded differential 
arithmetic assignments.

@ITEM HEAD =    FMODEL Declaration

@MINOR HEADING =  Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B> FMODEL <D><N><MI>name <D> <B>(<D>{ <MI>parameters<D>}<B>)<D>

@MINOR HEADING =  Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>name			<D>: identifying name (1-8 characters) 

@NOBULTAB = <MI>parameters<D>	: list of dummy parameters

This declaration generates a real function heading and initiates translation 
of the real variable assignment statements into overloaded differential 
arithmetic assignments.

@ITEM HEAD =    PROCEDURE Declaration

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

<LI><B>PROCEDURE<D> <MI>name <D>{ <B>(<MI>parameters<B>)<D> }</LI>


This declaration is an alias for a FORTRAN subroutine containing

<LI>IMPLICIT REAL*8 (A-H,O-Z)

as the first statement.  The use of this form is encouraged in order 
to insure type compatibility with other FORTRAN CALCULUS subprograms.</LI>

@ITEM HEAD =    OPERATOR Declaration

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

<LI><B>OPERATOR<D> <MI>name<D> { <B>(<MI>parameters<B>)<D> }</LI>

This declaration is an alias for a FORTRAN REAL*8 FUNCTION containing

<LI>IMPLICIT REAL*8 (A-H,O-Z)

as the first statement.  The use of this form is encouraged in order 
to insure type compatibility with other FORTRAN CALCULUS subprograms.</LI>

@ITEM HEAD =    DYNAMIC Declaration

@MINOR HEADING =  Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B> DYNAMIC <BI> <MI>v<MIV>1<MI>,...,v<MIV>n<D>

@MINOR HEADING =  Symbols:

@NOBULTAB =  <MI>v<MIV>1<D>,...,<MI>v<MIV>n<MV> 		<D>: variable names

This declaration specifies variables which may be allocated as real 
dynamic arrays using array assignment statements or the ALLOT statements, 
and thereafter deleted using the PURGE statement.  The FORTRAN equivalent 
of the declared variables are integer scalars used as pointers to 
arrays created as blocks of storage in the bucket. Subscripted references 
to these variables are translated into indexed positions in the bucket 
vector.  Subscripted (i.e. dimensioned) reference to these variables 
may not appear in common statements and when appearing unsubscripted 
in common must also appear in DYNAMIC statements in all program units 
having the same common, or be declared integer (implicitly or explicitly).  Dummy 
arguments of subroutines, MODELs or FMODELs may not be dynamic variables. 


@ITEM HEAD =    GLOBAL Declaration

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B>GLOBAL<D> <MI>classes<D> {<B>;<D> <B>IN<D> <MI>procedures<D> 
}

@MINOR HEADING = Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>classes		<D>:<N><MI>a list of : <B>REALS<D>|<B>CHARACTERS<D>|<B>INTEGERS<D>|<B>PRINCIPALS<D>|<B>ALL<D>

<LI>where REALS denotes all real variables, CHARACTERS denotes 
all character variables, INTEGERS denotes all integer variables, PRINCIPALS 
denotes all variables appearing in FIND, INITIATE, or INVOKE statements, 
and ALL denotes all program variables.</LI>

@NOBULTAB = <MI>procedures 	<D>:  a list of procedure names

This statement applies to an entire program and if used must precede 
the PROBLEM declaration.  It is used to define the scope of all of 
the variables in a given class as global within the named procedures.  It 
causes the translator to collect all variables in the specified classes 
and to include them in a common block /GLOBAL/.  Arrays declared in 
DIMENSION statements are included in dimensioned form.  Thus the DIMENSION 
statements only need appear once in the program. 

@ITEM HEAD =    GRAPHICS Declaration

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

<LI><B>GRAPHICS  SCREEN<D>|<B>FILE<D>|<B>BOTH<D></LI>

This statement applies to the entire program, and if used must precede 
the PROBLEM declaration.  It is used to select the mode of graphics 
output.  Thus if effects the selection of graphics utilities to be 
merged with the program by the linker.  A different set of utilities 
are associated with each option.  In the absense of this declaration, 
the default graphics mode is SCREEN.

@PAGE BREAK =

@NOBULTAB = <MI>namelist<D>		:				name {,<MI>namelist<D>}

This statement is used for constraint matching (simultaneous equation 
solving) and all forms of mathematical optimization (unconstrained-nonlinear, 
constrained nonlinear, linear, linear and mixed integer, zero-one, 
etc.).  Allowed phrases in FIND statements depend upon individual 
solvers, as specified in chapters 4, 6 and 7. The FIND statement performs 
two roles with respect to the calculus environment: (a) it defines 
the problem to be solved and its process of solution, and (b) it controls 
the solution process.

differential equations.  It specifies the integration solver; the 
model containing the differential equations; the ordinary derivative, 
dependent and independent variables of the equations; the nominal 
integration step size (usually varied by the solver); and the upper 
limit of integration.  The control of the solution process is subsequently 
performed by the INTEGRATE statement.

@ITEM HEAD =    INCALL statement

@MINOR HEADING =  Syntax:

@STATFORMAT =  <B>INCALL<D>  <MI>name <B>(<MI>arg<MIV>1<D>{<B>,<MI>arg<MIV>2<MI>,...arg<MIV>n<D>}<B>)<D>

@MINOR HEADING =  Symbols:

@NOBULTAB =  <MI>name<D> 			: subroutine name 

@NOBULTAB = <MI>arg<MIV>1<D>, <MI>arg<MIV>2<D> 		: argument variable

This statement is used to call an ordinary FORTRAN subroutine from 
a MODEL procedure for the purpose of receiving input from the subroutine.  If 
any of the argument variables are real, including dynamic reals, they 
will nominally be in calculus mode in the model. Thus an ordinary 
call (i.e. from MODEL to MODEL) will transmit the real arguments in 
calculus mode.  INCALL converts the incoming arguments from ordinary 
mode to calculus mode.

@ITEM HEAD =    OUTCALL statement

@MINOR HEADING =  Syntax:

@STATFORMAT =  <B>OUTCALL<D>  <MI>name <B>(<MI>exp1<D>{<B>,<MI>exp2,...expn<D>}<B>)<D>

@MINOR HEADING =  Symbols:

@NOBULTAB =  <MI>name <D> 		:  subroutine name

@NOBULTAB = <MI>exp<MIV>1<D>, <MI>exp<MIV>2 <D> 		:  argument expressions 


This statement is used to call an ordinary FORTRAN subroutine from 
a MODEL procedure for the purpose of transmitting output to the subroutine.  Real 
variables appearing in the argument expressions will nominally be 
in calculus mode in the model.  OUTCALL converts the outgoing variable 
values from calculus mode to ordinary mode before the call is made.

<H3> Command Calls</H3>

The command call is a class of macro statements which usually translates 
into a call to a special purpose library subroutine known to the FC 
translator.  It takes the form

<LI><B> @<BI>name <B>(<MI>arguments<B>)<D>>

where <BI>name<D> is the command identifier, which designates the 
subroutine to be called. Both the <BI>name<D> and the <MI>arguments<D> 
may be translated.</LI

This form may also be used for user-defined subroutine calls.  When 
employed in calculus context (in a MODEL  or FMODEL) a command call 
is translated as an OUTCALL.   This is particularly convenient for 
the modularization of graphical output subroutines for use as "commands".

@PAGE BREAK = 

<H3>   Output Streams and Report Generation</H3>

<BI>Output Streams<D> - In addition to ordinary FORTRAN I/O, FC supports 
three output streams for preformatted output reports:

<LI>CONSOLE - 80 column sequential standard output</LI>

<LI>SCROLL -<N>80 column contiguous set of "section" files</LI>

<LI>PRINTER - l32 column sequential file</LI>

@ITEM HEAD =  @STREAM - Routing output reports

At any time during program execution, one of these is designated as 
the "current" output stream.  The current stream is selected by the 
@STREAM command call,  as follows:

<LI><B>  @STREAM(<MI>n<B>)<MI></LI>

where <MI>n<D> is an integer expression whose value selects the output 
stream as follows:

@NOBULTAB = negative 		:  CONSOLE    

@NOBULTAB = zero 			:  PRINTER  

@NOBULTAB = positive 		:  SCROLL

The user may generate output to the individual streams via FORTRAN 
WRITE statements by referencing the logical unit numbers assigned 
to the streams.

The CONSOLE stream is always associated with standard output, so its 
logical unit number is the traditional FORTRAN unit 6.

The PRINTER stream file name is "PRINTER.PRN", and its default unit 
number is 7.

@ITEM HEAD =  @OUTDIAGS - Routing diagnostic output

Ordinarily, diagnostic messages are printed to the CONSOLE (standard 
output) if no @STREAM command has been executed.  When a @STREAM command 
is executed, diagnostic output is also routed along with reports.  
In order to route diagnostic output separately the @OUTDIAGS command 
is used:

<LI> <B>@OUTDIAGS(<MI>n<B>)<D></LI>

where <MI>n<D> has the same usage as for @STREAM.

@PAGE BREAK = 

@ITEM HEAD =  @OUTMERGE - Merging report and diagnostic streams

The @OUTMERGE command causes the diagnostic stream and the report 
stream to be merged, so that routing of both streams is subsequently 
controlled by @STREAM. This command may also be used to switch streams:

<LI> <B> @OUTMERGE(<MI>n<B>)<D></LI>

where n has the same usage as for @STREAM.

@ITEM HEAD =  @PRINTER - Assigning the PRINTER stream unit number

The unit number for the PRINTER stream may be changed using the command 
call

<LI> <B>  @PRINTER(<MI>unit<B>)<D></LI>

where <MI>unit<D> is an integer.

@ITEM HEAD =  @SCROLL - Assigning the SCROLL stream unit number

The unit number for the SCROLL stream may be changed using the command 
call

<LI><B>  @SCROLL(<MI>unit<B>)<D></LI>

where <MI>unit<D> is an integer.

@ITEM HEAD =  @SECTION - Separating SCROLL output into sections

The SCROLL stream is a succession of "section" files having the names 
SCROLL00.000 to SCROLL99.999, and its default unit number is 8.  Also 
associated with the SCROLL stream is a table-of-contents file named 
SCROLL.TOC.

The size and significance of SCROLL sections are under user control. 
SCROLL output may be segmented into sections of arbitrary length by 
the command call

<LI> <B> @SECTION(<MI>title<B>)<D></LI>

where <MI>title<D> is a character expression.  This statement closes 
the previous section file, opens its successor, and enters the title 
string in the SCROLL table-of-contents file.

Whenever the SCROLL stream is used for output reports (iteration reports 
and summary reports), each report is written on a separate SCROLL 
section, and a report title line is written to the SCROLL table- of-contents.

The output of the SCROLL stream may be perused using a special SCROLLER 
program, or may be copied to a single file for printing.



<BI>Preformatted Reports<D> - Preformatted output reports may be generated 
by the statements ROWPRINT, COLPRINT, VECPRINT, MATPRINT, TABULATE, 
GRADPRINT, HESSPRINT, AND PARDPRINT.  These statements produce reports 
on any of the preselected output streams according to their relation 
to the prior execution of a @STREAM statement.

Report formats for ROWPRINT, COLPRINT,  and TABULATE have controllable 
specifications, as follows:

@TABLE HEAD = Specification 	Usage 							Preset

@TABLE ITEM = LABELS 	Controls printing of variable names 		"on"

@TABLE ITEM = SKIPS 		Number of lines to be skipped before 	   1<R>
		each report 

@TABLE ITEM = MARGIN 	Number of blank characters in left		   1<R>
		print margin

@TABLE ITEM = FIELDS		Number of data fields					5<$FPRINTER stream> 
or 3<$FSCROLL or CONSOLE  stream>

@TABLE ITEM = WIDTH		Width of data fields					  21

@TABLE ITEM = DIGITS		Number of significant digiits				   7



@ITEM HEAD =    USE Statement

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B>USE<D> {<B>NO<D>} <B>LABELS<D>

@STATFORMAT = <B>USE<D> <MI>number<D> <B>SKIPS<D>

@STATFORMAT = <B>USE<D> <MI>number<D> <B>MARGIN<D>

@STATFORMAT = <B>USE<D> <MI>number<D> <B>FIELDS<D> <MI>width<D> <B>WIDE<D>

@STATFORMAT = <B>USE<D> <MI>number<D> <B>DIGITS<D>

@MINOR HEADING = Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>number<D>	: integer literal

@NOBULTAB = <MI>width<D>		: integer literal

This statement is used to specify the various aspects of the report 
format for the statements ROWPRINT, COLPRINT, and TABULATE.

@ITEM HEAD =    RESET Statement

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B>RESET FORMAT<D>

This statement is used to restore the preset default values of the 
format specifications.

@ITEM HEAD =    ROWPRINT  and COLPRINT

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B>ROWPRINT<D>|<B>COLPRINT<D> {<B>[<MI>title<B>]<D>} 
<MI>list<D>

@MINOR HEADING = Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>title		<D>:  character string

@NOBULTAB = <MI>list<D>			:  <MI>element<D> {,<MI> list<D>}

@NOBULTAB = <MI>element<D>	: scalar|array|array-element|array-part|expression

These statements cause sequential printing of both the names and values 
of the designated elements in a report paragraph having the heading:

@STATFORMAT = {title} VARIABLE VALUES .....

ROWPRINT causes names and values to be printed in equivalent positions 
of pairs of lines making name/value rows.  COLPRINT causes names and 
values to be printed in two columns (name column followed by row column).

@ITEM HEAD =    VECPRINT  and MATPRINT

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B>VECPRINT<D>|<B>MATPRINT<D>  <MI>list<D>

@MINOR HEADING = Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>list			<D>:  <MI>element<D> {, <MI>list<D>}

@NOBULTAB = <MI>element	<D>:  scalar|array|array-element|array-part

These statements generate individual reports for each<MI> list<D> 
element, in which numeric values are printed to seven figure precision.  There 
is a line eject preceding each report and the sequence of reports 
is specified by the order of the<MI> list<D>.

@PAGE BREAK = 

These statements are primarily intended for printing dynamic arrays 
(which contain their own dimensions).  Static arrays may be printed, 
but only as vectors, the lenghts of which are computed as the volume 
(product of all dimensions).  Where dimensions are passed as arguments, 
using the asterisk as the last dimension, the asterisk is assumed 
to represent unity.

Although these statements are not specifically intended for printing 
scalar variables, if any members of the lists are scalars or array 
elements, their values will be printed as follows:

<LI>SCALAR VARIABLE <MI>name<D> = <MI>value<D>  .</LI>

@ITEM HEAD =    TABULATE

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B>TABULATE<D>{<B>[<MI>title<B>]<D>} <MI>list<D> {<B>;<D> 
<B>LENGTH<D> <MI>exp<D>}

@MINOR HEADING = Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>title		<D>:<MI>  <D>character string<MI>

@NOBULTAB = <MI>list<D>			:  <MI>element<D> {, <MI>list<D>}

@NOBULTAB = <MI>element	<D>:  scalar|array|array-element|array-part

@NOBULTAB = <MI>exp			<D>:  integer expression

This statement will print a table of values having the arrays as its 
columns, from left to right as they appear in the <MI>list<D>.  Each 
static array or dynamic vector produces a single column, while each 
dynamic matrix produces a table column for each matrix column.  The 
entire <MI>list<D> may not generate more columns than will fit the 
page width of the output stream.

If the arrays have different numbers of rows, the shorter table columns 
are filled with blanks.  The LENGTH option provides a means of limiting 
the length of the table to <MI>exp<D> rows.

The format of the TABULATE statement may be controlled by preceding 
USE statements.

@PAGE BREAK = 

@ITEM HEAD =    GRADPRINT, HESSPRINT, and PARDPRINT

@MINOR HEADING = Syntax:

@STATFORMAT = <B>GRADPRINT<D>|<B>HESSPRINT<D>|<B>PARDPRINT<D>  <MI>list<D>

@MINOR HEADING = Symbols:

@NOBULTAB = <MI>list			<D>:  <MI>element<D> {,<MI>list<D>}

@NOBULTAB = <MI>element	<D>:  scalar|array element

These statements generate reports consisting of the element value 
and the selected partial derivative values for each element in the 
<MI>list<D>.

<LI>GRADPRINT selects the printing of gradient (first partial </LI>
derivative) vectors,

<LI>HESSPRINT selects the printing of Hessian (second partial </LI>
derivative) matrices, and 

<LI>PARDPRINT selects printing of both gradient vectors and </LI>
Hessian matrices.

If used when derivative evaluation is not active, these statements 
will result in messages stating that derivatives are not available.  Also, 
when variables in the <MI>list<D> are constants, or not functions 
of the independent variables, a similar message is displayed.

<H2><N>Special Syntax Rules</H2>

Since FC programs are translated into FORTRAN, certain enhancements 
to FORTRAN are provided, and certain peculiarities due to FORTRAN 
must be adhered to.

<B>Semi-colon:  Phrase Separator<D>

Because FORTRAN does not distinguish blanks as token separators, a 
delimiter is required to separate alphanumeric tokens.  Since each 
phrase of the calculus macro statements begins with a keyword, a semi-colon 
is required to prevent this keyword from being concatenated to the 
trailing identifier of the preceding phrase. Thus the somewhat awkward 
appearance of semi-colons in macro statements is necessary.

<B>Colon:  Statement Separator<D>

The colon is used as a statement terminator, allowing multiple statements 
on a line.  This will not conflict with FORTRAN usage of the colon 
in character expressions, since colons only appear parenthesized.  The 
other use of colons (also parenthesized) in DIMENSION statements is 
disallowed as indicated below.

<H2>  Special Restrictions</H2>

Since the FC translator must translate all of FORTRAN syntax, certain 
FORTRAN 77 embellishments have been deferred as a matter of lower 
priority.  A case in point is lower and upper bounds in DIMENSION 
statements.  The use of them will cause a syntax error.  The inclusion 
of them in later versions is a matter of demand priority.  

<B>Type Restrictions<D>

The most serious restriction is the lack of a COMPLEX type.  This 
will be rectified in the next major release.

In the FC implementations on 32-bit machines, there is no REAL*4 type.  This 
will cause a syntax error.  Since calculus reals require 64-bits, 
the allowance of 32-bit reals can potentially corrupt common storage 
when proper type declarations are inadvertently left out of a subroutine 
somewhere.  The errors that result from common corruptions are notoriously 
difficult to locate.  It is best therefore to eliminate the use of 
REAL*4.
